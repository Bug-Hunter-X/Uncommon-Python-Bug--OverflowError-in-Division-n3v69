This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug involving an OverflowError during division. The bug occurs when the integer division results in an overflow.  The solution addresses this by implementing alternative techniques to handle very large number divisions and adding explicit exception handling to detect and manage potential OverflowErrors.
